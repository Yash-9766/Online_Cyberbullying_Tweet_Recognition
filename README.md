# Online_Cyberbullying_Tweet_Recognition

Developed an effective solution to address cyberbullying using machine learning and natural language processing. Trained a model to accurately
identify and classify cyberbullying tweets with high accuracy. Additionally, I deployed the model on Streamlit, making it accessible and easy to use for
others. The project highlights my skills in machine learning and my passion for leveraging technology to solve real-world problems.
